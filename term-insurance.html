                                <h4>What is Term Insurance?</h4>
                                <p>Term Life Insurance is a pure protection plan which gives your family
                                    a huge amount of money in case you pass on any time during the
                                    term of the policy.</p>
                                <p>This huge amount of money which is received by your family in such a
                                    case is called Sum Assured. You can also call this Cover Amount.
                                    In return, you have to pay a small amount to the insurance company
                                    every year. This is called Premium.</p>
                                <p>In case you survive the entire term of the policy, your term insurance
                                    plan does not pay you anything.
                                    That is why it is a pure protection plan and the premiums which you
                                    pay are very small.</p>
                                <p>This term insurance plan is a legal contract between you and your
                                    insurance company. Once you purchase a term insurance plan, your
                                    life insurance company sends you a hard copy and a soft copy of this
                                    legal contract. This is your policy document.</p>
                                <p>This policy document contains all the terms and conditions of this
                                    contract.</p>

                                <p>Think of it this way.</p>
                                <p>What do you want your term insurance policy in your absence?
                                    Do you want it to replace your income so that your family continues to
                                    have the same amount of money every month as they used to have
                                    when you were around?.</p>
                                <p>Or do you want it to replace your expenses so that your dependents
                                    can continue to have the same lifestyle which they were used to even
                                    in your absence.</p>
                                <p>Or do you want it to cover your liabilities such as home loan or any
                                    other loan in case you pass on?
                                    After all, you are trying to provide financial security for your loved ones
                                    in your absence.</p>
                                <p>As a rule of thumb, you can opt for a sum assured of 15 to 20 times of
                                    your annual income. In case you have any liabilities, such as a home
                                    loan, you can add the outstanding amount to this.</p>
                                <p>So if you are a 30 year old and your annual income is INR 10 lacs,
                                    you can opt for a sum assured of INR 2 crores which would be 20
                                    times of your annual income. If you are 50 years old with the same
                                    income, you can opt for only 10 times of your annual income i.e. INR 1
                                    crore.</p>

                                <p>This is the time when a term insurance plan can help your family and

                                <p>In case of the unfortunate event of your passing on, term insurance
                                    plan provides a huge sum of money to your family. This helps your

                                <p>If you already have term insurance in place, the amount your family

                                <p>Suicides are horrible and can be the cause huge distress for loved ones
                                    who are left to deal with your sudden departure. Yet, term insurance plan

                                <p>Imagine you have a term insurance policy and you have kept the

                                    Now you fall sick and this sickness is so severe that you get confined
                                    to a wheelchair for sometime. I know it’s a nasty thing to say but you

                                <p>So just imagine if this happens to you, you would have a lot of other
                                    things to worry about. You might lose your day job because you could
                                    no longer go to the office.</p>
                                <p>You would have to pay for monthly rent, utilities, groceries and to top it
                                    all, you would also have to pay for your treatment. Paying Rs. 10 to 15
                                    thousand to keep your term insurance policy running would be the last
                                    thing you would want to do.</p>
                                <p>In this situation, you can ask your insurance company to keep your
                                    term insurance policy running by paying premiums on your behalf. All
                                    you have to do to activate this option is buy this add-on called Waiver
                                    of Premium by paying a little extra premium.</p>
                                <p>Insurance companies usually offer Waiver of Premium of Option in
                                    case of disability or critical illness such as Cancer. Please check what

                                    accident. Just to give you a perspective, imagine you bought a term
                                    insurance policy with a cover of Rs. 1 crore. You also took an
                                    accidental death benefit add-on with a cover of Rs. 1 crore.</p>
                                <p>In such a scenario, in case you die in an accident, your family will get
                                    Rs. 2 crores from the insurance company. This add-on gives an extra
                                    cushion just in case of accidental death and it comes very cheap. So
                                    why not have it, right?</p>
                                <p>But remember, in case you die of any other reason other than
                                    accident, your family just gets the basic sum assured of Rs. 1 crore.
                                    So it is not a good idea to reduce your basic term insurance cover
                                    amount just because you opted for this add-on.</p>

                                <p>Treatment of any critical illness also drains you and your family
                                    financially as it is very expensive. Imagine, what would be the situation
                                    if this were to happen 5 years from now. Steep rise in cost of medical

                                    amount when your doctor says that you have got any critical illness.
                                    Remember, that critical illness should be included in the add-on you
                                    buy.</p>
                                <p>You can use this cover amount to get yourself treated or to cover your
                                    other expenses.</p>
                                <p>This add-on is usually expensive and gets more expensive as you
                                    grow older. Rates also depend on the number of critical illnesses that
                                    are covered. We recommend you to read the details before you
                                    decide to purchase this.</p>
